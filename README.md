### [live preview](https://alidelice.vercel.app/)
Alidélice is an app I created to help my friend manage her Diwali cake sales at school more effectively. It gives her better visibility throughout the school, not just in a few classes, so she can sell all her cakes and avoid bringing unsold cakes back home. I'm really happy with the results.
